Utility for SRT files in command line in Java based on fredyw/jsrt.

- auto detect source encoding (with Mozilla Universal Charset), and convert it to UTF-8
- can add/substract an offset time in second.
- can change the frame rate timings via source and dest fps values.
- can calculate offset and rate factor to apply for each subtitle with the first and the last subtitle at wanted time.

Need only Java 7.
